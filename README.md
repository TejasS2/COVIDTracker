## Run the Website

You must go to the countries tab and press the "Fetch Countries" button to populate the database with all the countries.

In each country detail, you must select a calendar date and press the button "Fetch Data" to access the COVID-19 information for that date. Since, we are limited to 60 requests per minute, you must separately pick each date that you want for each country.

For the secrets.json, we have given a template that you must follow to be able to properly run the website. For the email and app password, you must make an app password for the gmail account you want to send emails from.
